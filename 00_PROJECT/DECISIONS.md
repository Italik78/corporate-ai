# DECISIONS

## 2026-09-18
1. Rebuild the Corporate AI architecture rather than blindly restarting the old stack.
2. Preserve existing working components, images, volumes and configurations.
3. Use NVIDIA-provided DGX Spark stack where it fits before writing custom infrastructure.
4. Keep NVIDIA DGX Dashboard for system operations.
5. Add a separate Corporate AI Console for application topology and service health.
6. Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NVFP4 remains the initial primary LLM.
7. GitHub repository Italik78/corporate-ai is the project source of truth.
8. No destructive cleanup during migration until data/config inventory is complete.
